# NOMA_5G

5G technology is the next big thing in wireless communication, promising faster and better services for things like videos and data traffic. To make this happen, we need smart ways to connect lots of devices at once. One of these smart ways is called Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access, or NOMA for short. It's like a traffic cop for data, allowing many devices to share the same space efficiently.
In the past, we used a different method called Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) to handle phone calls. But as more and more devices need to connect, OMA struggles to keep up. NOMA steps in to solve this problem, making sure all the devices can talk without causing too much chaos.Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access, or NOMA, is a clever technique that helps 5G networks handle multiple devices efficiently. It works by allowing different devices to use the same space, or frequency, at the same time. This is a bit like a crowded conference call where everyone can speak at once without talking over each other.
In this paper, I take a close look at how NOMA is shaping up in the world of 5G networks. I'll also compare how well OMA and NOMA work, showing why NOMA is a promising solution for our ever-growing need for fast and reliable wireless communication.
